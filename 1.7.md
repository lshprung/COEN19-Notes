# 1.7 Intro to Proofs p1

A **proof** is a valid argument where each proposition before the conclusion is **true (≡T)**, so the conclusion is **true (≡T)**

- e.g. Prove 7 < sqrt(59) < 8
	- Brainstorming
		- 7 = sqrt(49)
		- 8 = sqrt(64)
		- Because 59 is between 49 and 64, the statement should be true
	- 49 < 59 < 64
	- If x >= 0, y >= 0 and x<y, then sqrt(x) < sqrt(y)
	- sqrt(49) < sqrt(59) < sqrt(64)
	- sqrt(49) = 7
	- sqrt(64) = 8
	- Conclusion: 7 < sqrt(59) < 8
		- Because this follows from the previous **true** propositions, this is **true**

## Background for Proofs

- `x∈S` means x is **an element of** set S
- Famous sets
	- **Integers**: ℤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
	- **Rationals**: ℚ = {(a/b) | a,b∈ℤ, b!=0}
		- '|' means "such that"
			- ':' can also mean "such that"
	- **Reals**: ℝ
	- ℤ^+, ℚ^+, ℝ^+ are the **positive** integers, rationals, and reals, respectively

- Assume elementary school math e.g.
	- x,y∈ℤ -> x+y∈ℤ
	- m * (a/b) = (ma/b)
	- 1/(m/n) = (n/m)
	- a∈ℚ -> -a∈ℚ

- Do **not** assume things like odd+odd = even

Def: An integer n is even iff Ǝk∈ℤ s.t. n=2k
Def: An integer n is odd iff Ǝk∈ℤ s.t. n=2k+1

- Aside: people often write "assume p" whn they mean "assume p is true"

Ex. Prove that the square of an odd integer is odd
- Rewrite the sentence: "∀(integers)x, if x is odd, then x^2 is odd"
- Aside: To show a proposition is true ∀x∈S, one method is to show it is true for an arbitrary x∈S
- Can we say "5 is odd and 5^2 = 25 is odd" so the proposition is true?
	- This does not prove it, since it only shows the statement is true for 5, and 5 is not arbitrary

Scratch Work

|Given/Know/Assumptions|Want to Show|
|----------------------|------------|
|x is odd              |x^2 is odd  |
|x=2k+1 for some k∈ℤ   |x^2 = 2(ℤ)+1|

- The second to last step is called the "penultimate step"

- Let x be an arbitrary odd integer.
- Then, Ǝk∈ℤ s.t. x=2k+1.
- Then, x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k +1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k)+1
- Since (2k^2 + 2k)∈ℤ, x^2 is odd. ▣
	- ▣ is a symbol to show "done with proof"

- Scratch Work is useful for constructing a proof, but it is not necessary to submit in an hw assignment
	- If scratch work is included it MUST be clearly differentiated from the actual proof

This was an example of a **direct proof** of an implication. To show `p->q`, we assume p is true and show that it follows that q is true

## Proof by Contraposition

- Recall, `p->q ≡ ┓q->┓p`, so we can prove `p->q` by using the **contrapositive** and
	1. assume ┓q is true (q is false)
	2. show it follows that ┓p is true (p is false)

# 1.7 Intro to Proofs p2

- Ex. For all integers a,b is a*b is even, then a is even or b is even

Scratch Work

|Known|Want to Show|
|-----|------------|
|ab is even|a is even or b is even|
|ab = 2l, l∈ℤ|a=2(ℤ) or b=2(ℤ)|

- Direct Proof:
	- Let a,b be arbitrary integers where a*b is even. Then, Ǝl∈ℤ s.t. ab = 2l. a = (2l)/b = 2(l/b). We need to prove that l/b is an integer, but we don't know that it is :(

### Proof by Contraposition
- Prove if ┓(a is even or b is even), then ┓(a*b is even)
- If a is odd and b is odd, then a*b is odd

Scratch Work

|Known|Want to Show|
|-----|------------|
|a is odd, b is odd|ab is odd|
|a = 2k+1, k∈ℤ|ab = 2(ℤ)+1|
|b = 2l+1, l∈ℤ||

- Proof:
	- We proceed by contraposition, and assume a,b, are arbitrary odd integers. This means Ǝk,l∈ℤ s.t. a=2k+1 and b=2l+1. ab = (2k+1)(2l+1) = 4kl + 2k + 2l + 1 = 2(2kl + k + l) + 1. Since 2kl+k+l∈ℤ, ab is odd. ▣

### Proof by Contradiction

**Idea**: To show `p->q` **by contradiction**
1. First assume q is false (┓q is true)
2. Show this leads to a **contradiction**
3. This means our assumption that q is false is **wrong**, which means q is true

- Ex. Prove that there are no positive integer solutions to `x^2 - y^2 = 1`
	- Tipoff to Contradiction: the word "no"
	- Try contradition:

Scratch Work

|Know/Assumptions|Want to Show|
|----------------|------------|
|Ǝx,y∈ℤ^+ s.t. x^2 - y^2 = 1|Leads to a Contradiction|
||Maybe show both x and y are not positive integers|

Proof: Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are x,y∈ℤ^+ s.t. `x^2 - y^2 = 1`. Then, `(x-y)(x+y) = 1`. Since x,y∈ℤ, x-y∈ℤ and x+y∈ℤ. There are two possibilities: if both equal 1 or both equal -1. `2x=2` -> `x=1` and `y=0` is a solution. `2x=-2` -> `x=-1` and `y=0`. Neither of these solutions work, since in both, x or y are not ∈ℤ^+. This **contradicts** our assumption that x,y are positive integers. It follows that there are no positive integer solutions to `x^2 - y^2 = 1`. ▣

Recall: An **irrational** number is real, but not rational. (cannot be written as a ratio of integers)
- e.g. π, sqrt(2), sqrt(17), e

- Ex. Prove that the sum of a rational and an irrational number is irrational.
	- Reworded: "Prove if x is ratinoal and y is irratino, then x+y is irrational"

Direct Proof? x+y = (a/b)+y (a,b∈ℤ, b!=0) = (a +yb)/b. We know the denominator is an integer, but we're not sure if the numerator is an integer :(

Contraposition?
- "If x+y is rational, then x is irrational or y is rational"
- x+y = a/b: a,b∈ℤ, b!=0
- It's hard to say something about x,y individually :(
	- It is possible, however

### Proof by Contradition:

Scratch Work

|Known/Assumptions|Want to Show|
|-----------------|------------|
|x is rational    |Want to show Contradiction|
|y is irrational  |Maybe x is irrational or y is rational|
|x+y is ratioan   ||
|`x` + `y` = `x+y`||
|`y` = `x+y` - `x`||

Proof: Let x be rational and y be irrational. Assume for the sake of contradiction that x+y is rational. Then, x+y = a/b for some a,b∈ℤ, b!=0. Also, x = c/d for some c,d∈ℤ, d!=0. Then, `y=(x+y)-x` = `(a/b) - (c/d)` = `(ad - cb)/(bd)`∈ℚ since `ad-cd` and `bd` are integers and `bd!=0`. This contradicts the statement that y is irrational. It follows that `x+y` is irrational. ▣

## Tips

1. For proofs about **rationals**, if x∈ℚ, then `x=(a/b)` for some a,b∈ℤ, b!=0
2. For proofs about ℤ, avoid operations that give you non-integers like division or squareroot

Warning: When proving `p->q`, never assume what you are trying to prove (q) (it's called **circular reasoning**)
